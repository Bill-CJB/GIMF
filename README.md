Code for ICLR2025 Paper: [Neural Multi-Objective Combinatorial Optimization via Graph-Image Multimodal Fusion](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=4sJ2FYE65U)

**Quick Start For GIMF-P**

- To train a model, such as MOTSP with 20 nodes, run *train_motsp_n20.py* in the corresponding folder.
- To test a model, such as MOTSP with 20 nodes, run *test_motsp_n20.py* in the corresponding folder.
- Pretrained models for each problem can be found in the *result* folder.

**Quick Start For GIMF-C**

- To train a unified model, such as MOTSP, run *train_motsp.py* in the corresponding folder.
- To test a model, such as MOTSP, run *test_motsp.py* in the corresponding folder.
- Pretrained models for each problem can be found in the *result* folder.
